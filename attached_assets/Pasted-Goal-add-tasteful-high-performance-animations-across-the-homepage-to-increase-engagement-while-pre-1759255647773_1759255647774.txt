Goal: add tasteful, high-performance animations across the homepage to increase engagement while preserving readability and accessibility. Use CSS for simple transitions and a lightweight animation library (GSAP preferred) for complex timeline/scroll animations. Provide a CSS-only fallback and respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Design language / theme:

Primary blue: #1e90ff / secondary blue #0077cc

Accent yellow: #ffd24d → #ffd700

Rounded corners, soft shadows, moderate spacing

Use site variables (--primary, --accent, --radius, --ease) and keep animations under 400ms for micro-interactions

Deliverables:

HTML snippets (minimal, semantic)

CSS variables + classes for all animations

A small JS module (ES6) using GSAP + Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations with a CSS-only fallback

Notes about accessibility & performance, and prefers-reduced-motion support

Animation spec (component-by-component)

Hero (Parallax + Text Entrance + CTA)

Background: very subtle parallax on scroll (image shifts 10–15px slower than viewport).

Headline: 3-line staggered entrance — each line fades in + rises (y: 18px → 0) with 120ms stagger.

Subheadline: fades in after headline with 200ms delay.

CTAs: default state — blue gradient. On hover — animate background to yellow gradient (smooth 300ms), lift translateY(-4px), and slide-in arrow. On load: subtle scale (1 → 1.02) loop once.

Implementation hint: use GSAP timeline for headline and subheadline entrance. Parallax via translateY on background container (throttled by requestAnimationFrame or GSAP ScrollTrigger).

Why Choose / Feature Icons

Each icon + card: staggered fade-up on initial scroll into view (duration 420ms, ease out).

Microinteraction: hover the icon — small 3D tilt (rotateX / rotateY up to 6°) + glow ring (box-shadow pulse 300ms).

Implementation: Intersection Observer to trigger GSAP sequence only once.

Program Cards (Interactive)

Card load: subtle scale from 0.98 → 1 with opacity fade.

Hover: card lifts (translateY -8px), shadow increases, and the illustration performs a soft parallax shift (image moves slightly down and scale 1.04). Buttons animate color swap (blue → yellow) with underline sweep on the “Learn More”.

CTA inside card: a micro bounce on click (scale 0.98 → 1).

Implementation fallback: CSS :hover transitions for shadow and transform; JS-enhanced parallax optional.

Interactive Puzzle Panel

On scroll into view: puzzle floats in with a 3D rotation and soft bounce.

On hover over puzzle image: subtle floating bobbing animation (infinite but paused when not hovered). Clicking the puzzle “Go!” button should ripple from click point.

Implementation: CSS keyframes for bobbing + JS for click ripple effect.

Testimonials

Show as a carousel with 3D card stack transition (center card larger & forward, side cards slightly rotated and faded). Swiping or arrow click triggers GSAP timeline to animate rotation & z-index swap.

Each testimonial reveals stars with a quick scale/pop on show.

Provide an autoplay option (5–6s) that pauses on hover or keyboard focus.

Bottom CTA Strip

Use a slow gradient animation (animated background gradient shift left ↔ right 6s ease) behind CTA to create premium feel.

Button hover: animate to orange-yellow gradient and add a soft glow ring.

Micro-interactions & Accessibility

Focus states: all interactive elements must have visible focus rings (not just color change).

Keyboard navigable: carousel and all buttons must be usable via keyboard (arrow keys for carousel).

prefers-reduced-motion: detect and disable non-essential animations (parallax, infinite bobs, autoplay) — keep only instant state changes.

Provide aria-live or visually hidden status updates when carousel slides change.

Performance & Best Practices

Animate transforms and opacity only (avoid animating layout properties).

Use will-change sparingly on hover states only; remove after transition ends.

Debounce scroll listeners and prefer Intersection Observer or GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Minimize repaints: use GPU-accelerated transforms (translate3d) where necessary.

Bundle: provide an ES module with tree-shakable code; keep GSAP footprint minimal (only load the plugins used).

Fallbacks & CSS-only

Provide CSS-only hover states for CTA, cards and icons so the site remains interactive without JS.

For parallax and scroll-triggered reveals, fall back to simple CSS fade-in (no motion) if JS is disabled.

Testing checklist to deliver

Desktop, tablet, mobile responsiveness validated.

prefers-reduced-motion toggling tested.

Lighthouse performance and accessibility checks: animations should not drop CLS or increase TBT significantly.

Cross-browser checks (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
