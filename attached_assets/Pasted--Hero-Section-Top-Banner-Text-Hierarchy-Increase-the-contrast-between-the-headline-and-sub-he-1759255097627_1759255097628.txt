🔹 Hero Section (Top Banner)

Text Hierarchy – Increase the contrast between the headline and sub-headline (size difference or font weight).

CTA Buttons – Differentiate the two buttons (“Try Free Puzzle” and “Book Demo Class”) by using primary vs. secondary colors (e.g., one in blue, one in yellow gradient).

Background Overlay – Add a light dark overlay on the hero image so the text and buttons stand out more clearly.

🔹 Why Choose Abacuswalla

Icon Styling – Right now all icons look the same; add subtle colors based on theme (e.g., blue for math, green for focus, orange for confidence).

Grid Layout – Increase spacing between the 3x2 grid items for better breathing room.

🔹 Our Programs

Card Design – Add hover effects (light shadow + button color change) to make the program cards more interactive.

Illustrations – The illustrations are a bit large; reduce their size and bring the text upward for balance.

CTA Alignment – Highlight “Enroll Now” as the primary button (solid color) and make “Learn More” secondary (outlined).

🔹 Interactive Puzzle Section

Balance – The text block on the left and the puzzle image on the right don’t look balanced. Adjust sizing to make them visually equal.

Headline Emphasis – Add a stronger headline like “Gamified Learning = Faster Results” to capture attention.

🔹 Testimonials

Card Layout – Consider turning testimonials into a slider for better engagement.

Visual Trust – Add small profile pictures (dummy avatars) next to parent names to make them feel more authentic.

🔹 Call-to-Action (Blue Bar)

Background Gradient – Instead of solid blue, use a subtle gradient (blue → lighter blue).

Button Contrast – Add a hover effect to the yellow button (e.g., gradient yellow to orange).

🔹 Footer

Spacing – Increase padding at the top of the footer to avoid the cramped look.

Social Media Icons – Add icons (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) to build trust and encourage engagement.

Column Hierarchy – Move the “Contact Us” section to the left side so parents can spot it quickly.

👉 Overall:

Add hover animations (buttons, cards, icons).

Use more spacing and clear color hierarchy.

Focus on making CTAs and testimonials more engaging.
